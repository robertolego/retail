Suggested suppliers

- PMDWay (https://pmdway.com) has a huge range of items with free delivery.
- For Adafruit, DFRobot or SparkFun items - we recommend Mouser. They have free FedEx or UPS delivery for orders over $66. 
- For kits and A/V gear along with hardware and components, Altronics have a great range - and are really awesome people to deal with. 

For pretty much anything else - especially Raspberry Pi gear, there is RS (who offer free delivery). You can also use element14, 
just click "for business use" and pay via credit card.
