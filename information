Tronixlabs Pty Ltd has now closed its online retail channel. We are still in business using our other channels, such as ebay and B2B. 

You can always contact us using email via support@tronixlabs.com.

If you have purchased something online via our online store in the past, and ...
- require technical or product support for past purchases
- would like a refund for outstanding store credit or gift certificates
- have other questions

Simply email support@tronixlabs.com.


Suggested suppliers

- PMDWay (https://pmdway.com) has a huge range of items with free delivery.
- For Adafruit, DFRobot or SparkFun items - we recommend Mouser. They have free FedEx or UPS delivery for orders over $66. 
- For kits and A/V gear along with hardware and components, Altronics have a great range - and are really awesome people to deal with. 

For pretty much anything else - especially Raspberry Pi gear, there is RS (who offer free delivery). You can also use element14, 
just click "for business use" and pay via credit card. 

If you need help finding an item, email support@tronixlabs.com
